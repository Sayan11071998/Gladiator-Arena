# ***🚀 Gladiator Arena 🎮***

I’m genuinely excited (and slightly entertained!) to share my latest Unreal Engine 5 project—Gladiator Arena! This project wasn’t just about leveling up my skills in 3D game design, C++, Blueprints, and AI systems—it was also unexpectedly hilarious watching tiny dwarfs run around with their little legs in the arena. Sometimes, game development gives you these surprising moments of fun, and this project definitely delivered!

### **🎮 Game Features**
- **⚔️ Third-Person Arena Combat:** Wield a hammer and shield in intense combat as dwarfs try to keep up! Watching the mix of serious combat with tiny-legged warriors definitely adds to the entertainment.
- **🤖 Advanced Enemy AI:** Don’t be fooled by their size—the enemies may be small, but their brains aren’t. These guys team up like they're having an epic strategy meeting... with hammers.
- **❤️‍🩹 Health & Damage System:** Every hit counts! Players and enemies have health points, but watching those little warriors take hits is just too cute.
- **🔨 Hammer Mechanics:** Swinging a big hammer has never been this satisfying—especially when you see the enemies wobbling away after getting smashed!
- **🔄 Game Restart Function:** Because sometimes, you just need to see those tiny legs running around the arena one more time.

### **🧠 Key Learnings**
- **🎮 Core Gameplay Mechanics:** Mastered the fundamentals using Blueprints and C++.
- **🏃‍♂️ Smooth Movement:** Implemented fluid movement for both characters and enemies—trust me, watching the dwarfs shuffle around was pretty adorable.
- **🎥 Fluid Animations:** Developed smooth animations for player and enemy actions—because even tiny-legged gladiators deserve style!
- **🧠 Advanced AI System:** Created challenging enemy behavior, even when I couldn’t stop laughing at their cute movements.
- **🔄 Restart Functionality:** Added the ability to reset the game, for those times when you just can’t get enough of the tiny-legged warriors.

This project was filled with late nights, challenges, and more laughs than I expected. Sometimes, it’s the unexpected fun moments that remind me why I love game development so much. I’m super proud of how this turned out and can’t wait for the next adventure (maybe with more tiny-legged gladiators)! 💪
